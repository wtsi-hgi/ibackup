	Use:   "get",
	Short: "Safely copy files from iRODS to a local filesystem",
	Long: `Safely copy files from iRODS to a local filesystem.

Use the -f arg (defaults to STDIN) to provide a tab-delimited file with these 2
columns:
/absolute/path/of/local/file /remote/irods/path/of/file

Because local and remote paths could contain tabs and newlines in their names,
you can base64 encode them and use the --base64 option.

get will then efficiently copy all column 2 paths in iRODS to column 1
locations, using a single connection, sequentially. (This makes it orders of
magnitude faster than running 'iget' for each of many small files.)

get will always confirm the checksum stored on the server side in flight, but
will not confirm the data stored on disk.

It will not overwrite existing local files unless the -o/--overwrite flag is
provided. Remote files with the same mtime as a local file will always be
skipped so it should be safe to run get multiple times without redownloading
files many times.

Remote files that are denoted as hardlinks will be skipped with a warning
containing the intended local path and the remote path that contains the actual
hardlink data.

If remote file paths are missing, warnings about them will be logged, but this
cmd will still exit 0. It only exits non-zero on failure to download an existing
remote file.

Directories for your local paths in column 2 will be automatically created if
necessary.

(The ibackup server also calls this command with the --server and --url options
instead of a 2 column -f file, which makes this command work on restore requests
stored in the server.)

You need to have the baton commands in your PATH for this to work.

You also need to have your iRODS environment set up and must be authenticated
with iRODS (eg. run 'iinit') before running this command. If 'iget' works for
you, so should this.`,
